"""DOCTYPE strategy pattern for format-specific DOCTYPE handling.

This module provides a strategy pattern for handling DOCTYPE declarations
in different document formats (HTML5, XML, etc.). Each strategy determines
the appropriate DOCTYPE behavior for its format, including default DOCTYPEs
and whether DOCTYPEs should be ensured for complete documents.
